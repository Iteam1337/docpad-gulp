### Sharing is caring

We share and learn from each other. All the time. Code lunches, mentorships, lab hours, lounge hacks, open source project contributions, the Facebook group Kodapor, conferences and in our day-to-day-work. Knowledge is power.

### Relationships - not projects

Our clients have big opportunities to make a difference. They’re past computerization and want to lead digitalization within their domains. That takes time. It’s not done through an isolated project a couple of months long, but through long-lasting work affecting the entire organization. That’s why we often have long relationships with our clients. And make sure we become good friends along the way.
