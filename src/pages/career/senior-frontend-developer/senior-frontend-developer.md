## Your role
As an experienced developer at Iteam you help our customers with digital solutions that truly create value. Solutions that result in something good for both the customer, end-user and society at large.

You work in agile, cross-functional teams that build innovative applications using the latest technologies.

* Work well with others (pair programming, mentoring, work in cross-functional teams)
* Proficient in written and spoken English
* Build modern JavaScript/HTML/CSS-applications (probably using React)
* CSS and preprocessors (e.g. SASS, Less)
* Write testable code and automated tests
* Tools for automation (Docker, Gulp, Grunt, Webpack)


## Nice-to-haves
* You contribute to the developer community (e.g. open source projects or meetups)
* E2E-testing (e.g. Selenium)
* Experience with other Javascript-frameworks (e.g. Angular, Vue)
* Understanding of backend development
* Anything else you might know that we don't yet know we need? Surprise us!
